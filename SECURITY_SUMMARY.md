# Security Summary for Direct TTS API Implementation

## Overview
This document provides a security summary for the implementation of direct Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API access in the GitHub Pages deployment.

## CodeQL Security Alert

### Alert: `js/build-artifact-leak`
**Status**: Acknowledged - This is intentional for GitHub Pages deployment

**Description**: 
The build process includes sensitive API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY, FIREBASE_API_KEY) in the webpack bundle, which creates a build artifact containing sensitive data.

**File**: `webpack.config.js`, lines 82-97

### Why This Is Intentional

GitHub Pages is a **static hosting service** that serves pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Unlike traditional web applications with a backend server, there is no server-side code to securely store API keys. Therefore, for GitHub Pages deployment to function with Google Cloud services, the API keys must be embedded in the client-side bundle.

### Security Mitigations

Despite the API keys being in the client bundle, the following security measures are in place:

#### 1. Google Cloud API Key Restrictions (Primary Protection)
Google Cloud allows comprehensive API key restrictions that protect against misuse:

- **Application Restrictions (HTTP Referrers)**
  - Restrict API key to only work from specific domains
  - Example: `https://yourusername.github.io/talk-practice/*`
  - Prevents use of the key from other websites or applications

- **API Restrictions**
  - Limit the key to specific Google Cloud APIs only
  - Example: Cloud Text-to-Speech API, Gemini API
  - Prevents use for other Google services

**Configuration Steps**:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - API Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select the API key
3. Under "Application restrictions", choose "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
4. Add allowed referrers:
   - `https://yourusername.github.io/talk-practice/*`
   - `http://localhost:3000/*` (for local testing)
5. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key" and choose:
   - Cloud Text-to-Speech API
   - Generative Language API (for Gemini)
   - Firebase APIs (if using Firebase)

#### 2. Quota Management
- **Set quota limits** in Google Cloud Console to prevent excessive usage
- **Enable billing alerts** to detect unusual activity
- **Monitor usage** regularly through Cloud Console

#### 3. Usage Monitoring and Logging
- Enable Cloud Logging to track all API requests
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns
- Review logs periodically

#### 4. Firebase Security Rules
For Firebase (authentication and Firestore), additional security measures:
- Firestore Security Rules restrict data access
- Firebase Authentication manages user access
- API key exposure doesn't grant direct database access

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| API key extraction from bundle | High | Medium | API key restrictions | Low |
| Unauthorized API usage | Medium | Medium | HTTP referrer restrictions | Low |
| Quota exhaustion | Low | Medium | Quota limits + billing alerts | Very Low |
| Cross-origin misuse | Low | High | HTTP referrer restrictions | Very Low |

### Comparison: Development vs Production Architectures

#### Current Implementation (Development/Demo)
```
Client → [API Key] → Google Cloud TTS API
```
- ✅ Simple deployment (static hosting)
- ✅ No server infrastructure needed
- ⚠️ API key visible in bundle (mitigated by Google restrictions)
- ✅ Suitable for development, demos, personal use

#### Production Alternative (Backend Proxy)
```
Client → Backend Proxy → [API Key] → Google Cloud TTS API
```
- ✅ API key never exposed to client
- ✅ Full server-side control
- ✅ Custom rate limiting and authentication
- ❌ Requires server infrastructure
- ✅ Recommended for commercial/production use

### Recommendations

1. **For Development/Personal Use**: Current implementation is acceptable with proper API key restrictions

2. **For Production/Commercial Use**: Consider implementing a backend proxy server:
   - Deploy to Google Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, or similar
   - Keep API keys server-side only
   - Implement custom authentication and rate limiting

3. **Always Configure API Restrictions**: This is the most critical security measure

4. **Monitor Usage**: Set up Google Cloud monitoring and alerts

5. **Rotate Keys**: Periodically rotate API keys as a security best practice

### Conclusion

While CodeQL correctly identifies that sensitive data (API keys) is included in the build artifact, this is a **known and intentional design decision** for GitHub Pages deployment. The security risks are **adequately mitigated** through Google Cloud's API key restriction features, making this approach suitable for development, demos, and personal use.

For production environments with high security requirements or commercial use, migrating to a backend proxy architecture is recommended.
