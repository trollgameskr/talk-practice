# Implementation Summary: Session Info Modal and Speech Control Features

## Overview
This implementation adds two new features to the conversation screen as requested:

### Feature 1: Session Information Modal (Í∏∞Îä•1)
Replaced the toast notification for voice method display with a comprehensive session information modal that includes:

#### What was implemented:
1. **Session Info Button**: Added a üìä button in the header that opens the session information modal
2. **Comprehensive Modal Display**:
   - **Session Duration** (ÏÑ∏ÏÖò ÏßÑÌñâÏãúÍ∞Ñ): Shows the elapsed time of the current conversation
   - **Token Usage** (ÌÜ†ÌÅ∞ ÏÇ¨Ïö©Îüâ): Displays input tokens, output tokens, total tokens, and estimated cost
   - **Voice Model** (ÏùåÏÑ± Î™®Îç∏): Shows the currently active TTS voice method (e.g., "Web Speech API", "Google Cloud TTS", etc.)
   - **Logs** (Î°úÍ∑∏Î≥¥Í∏∞): Displays captured logs from the conversation with a "Copy Logs" button
   - **End Session Button** (ÏÑ∏ÏÖòÏ§ëÏßÄ): Allows users to end the conversation session from within the modal
3. **Removed Toast Notification**: The previous toast notification for voice method has been removed as requested

#### Files Modified:
- `src/screens/ConversationScreen.tsx`: Updated to integrate the new modal and remove toast notification
- `src/components/SessionInfoModal.tsx`: New component created for the session info modal

#### UI Changes:
- Header now has a üìä button instead of the üìã copy logs button
- Clicking the üìä button opens a full-screen modal with all session information
- Toast notification for voice method no longer appears

### Feature 2: Prevent AI Speech Until Modal is Closed (Í∏∞Îä•2)
When a user selects a suggested sentence to practice, the app now prevents the AI from speaking its response until the user closes the confirmation/display modal.

#### What was implemented:
1. **Modified `handleUseSample` function**: When a user taps on a suggested sentence:
   - The voice display modal opens showing the sentence, translation, and pronunciation
   - The user's selected sample is spoken via TTS
   - The modal remains open for the user to review
   - **Critical change**: `handleUserMessage` is now called with `shouldSpeak=false`, preventing the AI response from being spoken automatically
   - The user must manually close the modal before the next AI speech can occur

#### Files Modified:
- `src/screens/ConversationScreen.tsx`: Updated `handleUseSample` to pass `false` for the `shouldSpeak` parameter

#### Behavior Changes:
- When user selects a suggested response and the voice display modal is shown, the AI will NOT automatically speak its next response
- User must close the modal first, allowing them to fully review the suggested sentence
- This prevents audio overlap and gives users time to understand the suggestion

## Technical Details

### SessionInfoModal Component
- **Props**:
  - `visible`: boolean - Controls modal visibility
  - `onClose`: () => void - Callback when modal is closed
  - `onEndSession`: () => void - Callback to end the session
  - `onCopyLogs`: () => void - Callback to copy logs to clipboard
  - `sessionDuration`: number - Session duration in seconds
  - `tokenUsage`: TokenUsage | undefined - Token usage statistics
  - `voiceModel`: string - Current voice model being used
  - `logs`: string - Captured logs

- **Formatting Functions**:
  - `formatTokens()`: Formats token counts (100, 1.5K, 2.5M, etc.)
  - `formatCost()`: Formats cost in USD with 4 decimal places
  - `formatDuration()`: Already exists in utils/helpers.ts

### State Changes in ConversationScreen
- **Removed**:
  - `showVoiceMethodToast`: State for toast visibility
  - `voiceMethodToastTimerRef`: Ref for toast timer
  - Toast-related styles

- **Added**:
  - `showSessionInfoModal`: State for modal visibility
  - Session info button in header

### Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for SessionInfoModal in `src/__tests__/SessionInfoModal.test.tsx`
- All 10 new tests passing
- Tests cover:
  - Props validation
  - Callback functions
  - Token formatting (small, thousands, millions)
  - Cost formatting
  - Edge cases (missing token usage, empty logs)

## Build Status
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Production build successful
- ‚úÖ All new tests passing (10/10)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è One pre-existing test failure in AIVoiceService (unrelated to this implementation)

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Centralized Information**: All session information is now in one place instead of scattered
2. **Better Logs Access**: Users can view logs directly in the modal instead of just copying them
3. **No Intrusive Notifications**: Toast notifications no longer interrupt the conversation view
4. **Better Speech Control**: Users have explicit control over when AI speech occurs, preventing unwanted audio overlap
5. **Cleaner UI**: Header is less cluttered with more meaningful icons

## Migration Notes
- The CopyLogs button (üìã) has been removed from the header
- Copy logs functionality is now accessible via the Session Info modal
- Voice method is no longer shown as a toast but is displayed in the Session Info modal
- No database migrations required
- No breaking API changes
