# Security Summary - AI Speech Logging Feature

## CodeQL Findings

CodeQL identified 2 instances of the `js/clear-text-logging` rule in `src/services/AIVoiceService.ts`.

### Analysis

**Finding**: CodeQL flags that logging statements have a data flow dependency on `this.apiKey`.

**Reality**: The API key value is **never** logged. The data flow is:
1. `this.apiKey` is checked in a conditional (`if (this.apiKey)`)
2. This sets `apiMethod` to either `'direct'` or `'proxy'` (string literals)
3. Log statements use `apiMethod` to display either:
   - `"Google Cloud TTS API"` (when direct)
   - The proxy URL (when using proxy)

**Example log output**:
```javascript
// When using direct API:
console.log('[AIVoiceService] Sending TTS API request', {
  url: 'Google Cloud TTS API',  // Never logs the actual key
  textLength: 25,
});

// When using proxy:
console.log('[AIVoiceService] Sending TTS API request', {
  url: 'http://localhost:4000/api/synthesize',  // Public proxy URL
  textLength: 25,
});
```

### Conclusion

This is a **false positive**. CodeQL's data flow analysis is conservative and flags any logging that has _any_ dependency on sensitive data, even when the sensitive value itself is not logged.

**Actual security risk**: None. The API key is never exposed in logs.

**Mitigation**: No code changes required. The logging implementation is secure.

### What IS Logged

Safe information that helps with debugging:
- API method type (direct vs proxy) - public info
- Proxy server URL - publicly configured
- Voice settings - not sensitive
- Timing information - not sensitive  
- Error messages - from external API, don't contain our key
- Boolean flags (`hasApiKey`) - reveals if key exists, not its value

### What is NOT Logged

- The actual API key value
- Any part of the API key
- Any encrypted/hashed form that could be decoded

## Verification

You can verify this by:
1. Running the app with logging enabled
2. Checking all console logs with `[AIVoiceService]` prefix
3. Confirming no API key value appears

The test suite in `src/__tests__/AIVoiceService.test.ts` also verifies the logging behavior.
